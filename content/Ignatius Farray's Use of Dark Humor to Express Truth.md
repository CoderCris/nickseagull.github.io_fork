Ignatius Farray is a Canarian comedian known for using dark humor to express truths.

He laughs at authoritarian power structures (politics, church, right-wing) and at minorities (feminism, ill people).

Importantly, he also laughs at himself and his own misfortunes (divorce, drinking problems, inability to see his son).

His humor comes from a position opposite of privilege.
