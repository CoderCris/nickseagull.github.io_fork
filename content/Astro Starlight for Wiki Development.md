## Key Points
- **Astro Advantage:** Astro suits static website needs and allows React integration, making it favorable over Gatsby and Quartz.
- **Starlight as a Solution:** Starlight, built on Astro, supports wiki functionalities and Obsidian markdown transformations for static web rendering.
- **Seamless Integration:** The Starlight theme enhances the experience by supporting Obsidian features like backlinks and graph visualizations.
- I did a hack though: [[Hacking Stalight-Obsidian for MDX support]].
