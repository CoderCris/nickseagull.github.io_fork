A curse works similarly to the [[Placebo]] effect—if someone believes they are cursed, their [[Belief]] can negatively impact their perception, making bad things seem more pronounced.

This illustrates how negative suggestions, much like positive placebo effects, can influence one’s reality by directing focus toward harmful or negative outcomes.

Could be interesting to research the nocebo effect, psychology of negative thinking, and self-fulfilling prophecies.
