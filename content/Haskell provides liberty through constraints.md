## Key Concept

Haskell’s strong type system and functional purity create a different kind of liberty—one where constraints guide clearer thinking. This is the [[Paradox of Liberty Through Constraint]].

## Elaboration

Even though developers might not adopt pure functional programming entirely, Haskell requires a disciplined approach to design. Its separation of side effects and data transformations forces one to reason about code structure in a more rigorous way.

## Implication

The constraints of Haskell limit initial freedom but lead to a deeper understanding of program logic and data flow, helping the developer model problems more precisely.
