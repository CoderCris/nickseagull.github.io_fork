Magick with K, to separate it from the concept of Hollywood-esque supernatural magic, is the use of symbolic actions or [[Belief]]s to create changes in perception, rather than something supernatural.

Magick becomes a set of psychological techniques or rituals that leverage the [[Placebo]] effect to affect oneâ€™s perception of reality.

It is essentially a mix of psychological rituals, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and symbolic action. Things that you would do in therapy.
