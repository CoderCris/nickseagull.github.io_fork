## Key Points
- **Quartz capabilities:** Quartz is a tool designed to convert Obsidian Vaults into a static, [[Wiki-style website]]. It supports markdown and basic configurations.
- **Limitations:** Quartz uses a pipeline based on Rehype and Remark to render static sites, which limits interactive components.
- **Potential for React integration:** Although React could technically be hacked into Quartz, the effort required was deemed excessive.
- I tried to use Gatsby for this, but also found [[Challenges using Gatsby for Obsidian websites]].
