Although atheist, I increasingly focus less on strict disbelief and more on the placebo effect as a practical tool.

The placebo effect shows that [[Belief]] alone can lead to tangible results, even if it doesnâ€™t address underlying physiological causes.

It can be used not just for healing, but for altering daily life perceptions, helping with focus, emotional management, or enhancing experiences.

By deliberately applying belief-based techniques, one can consciously shape their daily experience, similar to how faith supports religious individuals in tough times.
