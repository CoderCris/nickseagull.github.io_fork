- **Ease of Use:** Gatsby initially promises easy scaffolding for React projects.
- **GraphQL and Plugins Issues:** Challenges arose from generating markdown pages and managing peer dependencies.
- **Version Compatibility:** Difficulty in integrating markdownx plugins with the current Gatsby version led to dropping Gatsby.
- I ended up transitioning to [[Astro Starlight for Wiki Development]]
